# OBS Replay lib

## Overview
This library allows to generate replay using libobs library. Overall, OBS implements efficient way of the screen capturing with the high FPS.

MS Windows provides a several API for that, probably the most efficient is a Screen Duplication API, which is using DirectX undernise. However, only OBS provides a complete solution which allows to capture screen with the stable FPS level.

Pay attention, that 60 fps level for the 1920x1020 resolution could be achived only with the dedicated GPU card (in my case NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti).

What is also good with OBS is that, your CPU remain almost fully unused.
