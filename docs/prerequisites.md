# Prerequisites

Before to start, you have to download a latest compiled libOBS binaries or compile it your own (might be tough).

[MS Windows OBS build 27.5.32](https://obsstudios3.streamlabs.com/libobs-windows64-release-27.5.32.7z)

Pay attention, that libOBS is a core of the OBS but without any UI.

libOBS consists from libOBS core library and the plugings + plugins configuration files.
All the plugings will be loaded dynamically.
